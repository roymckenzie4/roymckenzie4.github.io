There are three things I look for when visiting a state park:

1.	A body of water (in case I can swim)
2.	A nice walk (to see the sights)
3.	A spiritual destination: something strange, singular, and sublime that gives a little meaning to my visit (this is MOST important)

This week, I am happy to report that **Harpeth River State Park**, which I visited at the beginning of this month in the heart of middle Tennessee, is a shining example for all three of these criteria.

The water is pretty self explanatory: the park lies along 40 miles of the Harpeth River, a lumbering, limestone green tributary that juts south from the Cumberland. I knew that it was everything that a good river should be when, getting out my car in the parking lot, I could already hear the siren song murmur of water churning over rocks, that, even on the cool December day of my visit, made the appeal of the water difficult to resist.

The hike I took was slightly less enticing: ninety feet up a narrow limestone ridge carved out by the switchbacks of the river, with the kind of flat, vertical, instant-death drop on each side that makes me clutch at my glasses for fear I’ll lose them for good. At the top of the ridge, however, this feat of vertigo is rewarded by lush views of the Harpeth below and the stretch of Tennessee farmland beyond.

But for me, neither the river nor these vistas were the real reason for my visit. Instead, the driving force behind my trip (and the spiritual destination of my journey) was **the Montgomery Bell Tunnel**, proudly advertised by the Tennessee state parks website as “one of the oldest man-made tunnels in existence today”.

This claim captivated me because I knew that it _must_ be a complete lie – the tunnel dates to only 1818, and there is just no way one of the oldest extant tunnels in existence was created the same year _Frankenstein_ was released. But - like the “largest tree in Minnesota” or the “most dangerous place to swim in Missouri” - this promise is just the kind of suspect superlative that makes a state park irresistible.[^1]

[^1]: For the curious reader, the extent to which this is a complete lie depends on how limited you interpret “one of”, and, potentially, “tunnel”. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdstall). But who’s keeping score? It is, however, the “oldest known full-size tunnel” in the U.S., per the original landmark [nomination](https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/GetAsset/NHLS/94001188_text), which may have been what TN State Parks was trying to get at.

The tunnel – 290 feet long, 15 feet wide, and 8 feet tall – was used to divert water from the river to power Montgomery Bell’s iron forgery. It sits at one end of a short walk from the parking lot - a stony mouth caught mid-yawn, drooling a steady trickle of water into its reflecting pool below. The wall of limestone that the tunnel cuts through is massive, a (nearly!) uninterrupted expanse of crackling grey stretching off in each direction. It gives the place the feel of a secret grotto, with the flash of green at the far end of the tunnel itself the only glimpse of the world “outside”.

Now, I'll be honest with you: I wanted to feel the magic of this hidden little alcove. I wanted to stand in the mouth of the tunnel and be so-o-o moved by the engineering and labor it took to open up that rocky corridor. But here, the tunnel mostly just struck me as... a hole in a rock.

I don’t intend that as a particular knock on Mr. Bell's tunnel; all tunnels are, inherently, an absence of something. They have no substance of their own to be admired; they are an indication of something missing. And, for me, that missigness is inherently unsatisfying (or at least, I found it to be so on this particular day).

Luckily, at Harpeth River, that which is missing didn’t have far to go. The limestone chunks that previously occupied the space that is now the Montgomery Bell tunnel sit like jumbled tombstones just on the bank of the reflecting pool, exactly where (presumably) Mr. Bell had them left two hundred odd years ago. And so, fter I concluded my short examination of the tunnel, I turned my attention to these boulders, and began to search for a rock to skip.

I like skipping rocks. I spent a lot of time as a kid throwing rocks into bodies of water - rivers, lakes, ponds, creeks, and even the occasional drainage ditch. It’s part of a childhood summer in the south, I think, to sit near these pools and toss any rock within arm’s reach into them, in the (usually vain) hope of getting a few nice bounces. I spent countless hours of my childhood pursuing the perfect rock, and the perfect skip – all the while moving pound after pound of stone from land to sea and (likely) serving as the leading cause of erosion for a ten-mile radius around my house.

Through this process, I often found myself reflecting on how, from the point of view of the rock, our relationship must have seemed like an extraordinary twist of fate. Think - for tens, hundreds, or even thousands of years, each day in that rock’s life had been routine: the same little spot on the bank, the sun casting familiar shadows. But then, suddenly, warm (dry?) fingers. The experience of flight! And PLUNK - into the water, where suddenly everything is different – the start of a new normal, day by day at the bottom of the brook.

At Harpeth River, I was reminded of these musings as I began searching for flat pebbles amongst the rubble left on the bank. Much like the skipping rocks of my childhood, these stones had enjoyed a very routine existence for many, many years as a limestone wall, interrupted by one VERY unusual encounter with a nineteenth century hand drill. For a brief moment, their lives were in glorious, tumbling motion! New light, new air, new water - all of it changing quickly, from second to second! But then, just as quickly, these old stones were again at rest...

Or they were, until I began to pick up a few of their smaller friends and skip them across the water’s surface.

I empathize with these Harpeth rocks. My life too, lately, has been marked by stretches of stability, broken up by sudden skips across the water. These skips might be scary – like getting in a car accident or getting picked up by a tornado. They might be good – like winning the lottery or finding a new friend. In either case, they often leave me falling, flying, and tumbling in turmoil, uprooted suddenly from the calm (but stagnant?) bank that I had occupied.

No one has ever accused me of doing well with change, and in these moments, it’s easy to focus on the tunnel – the space left behind in the life I just occupied, before the forces of chance picked me up and spun me around. But the real beauty of a tunnel isn't that something is missing - it's that something once was there. The real meaning of my trip to Harpeth River wasn't the tunnel, or even the rocks themselves, but instead the movement and change that they are a monument to.

There's a new year coming, and I think I'm going to lie down, try to be as flat as I can, and lean into the skip – be it fly, flow, or flop. If I've got to move, I'd at least like to get a couple nice bounces out of it!
